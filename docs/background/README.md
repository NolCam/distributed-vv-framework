# Background / Introduction

This framework is a draft technical design for a distributed-data Verification & Validation (V&V) system. Its purpose is to provide a scalable, end-to-end pipeline that:

1. Ingests raw simulation outputs
2. Applies a set of programmable validation checks against those outputs.
3. Stores both raw and processed data in versioned “Delta Lake” tables.
4. Generates audit-ready V&V reports for simulation engineers and accreditors.
5. Orchestrates all steps in a Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) manner, so that new validation rules or framework components can be added quickly.

### Goals

- **Scalability**: Leverage Apache Spark and Databricks to handle large volumes of simulation data.  
- **Modularity**: Enable a “plugin-style” architecture so that new validation checks (statistical, anomaly, domain‐specific) can be dropped in without rewriting the entire pipeline.  
- **Auditability**: Ensure that every data artifact and report is versioned (via Delta Lake time-travel and/or Git LFS) for traceability.  
- **Automation**: Use Databricks Workflows (or similar schedulers) for event-driven and time-based triggers, backed by GitHub‐hosted code.
